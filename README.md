This is a Repository build for personal learning. 
The idea is to build a project which helps to build a full stack application starting from scratch. This will include learnings regarding
Java, Spring Boot, Git, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, React ( which will be in a seperate repository ), and databases like Mysql or 
MongoDB.
Further more would like to invite learners to add your ideas by implementing and sharing it with the community.
